# Practice-Shortest_Path
I. intro In my Intro to Algorithm class (undergrad)
I did my homework where I had to implement some shortest path algorithms.
They were the followings:
 1) Bellman-Ford Algorithm
 2) Dijkstra Algorithm
 3) Floyd-Warshall Algorithm 
 
Codes that I uploaded in this project is the result of that homework. 
I thought I could share it with anyone who might need it.

II. specifications about code
-Language : C
-Dev. Environment : Linux / vim editor / gcc
-input data : .txt file
-output : stdout

III. how to run the code: 
$ gcc main.c shortestPath.c graph.c heap.c list.c 
$ ./a.out hw5.data
